# Portfolio Guide: How to Present This Project

Use this checklist to make your GitHub repo shine for recruiters:

- ✅ Clear README with architecture diagram (Elastic + Logstash + Kibana + Elastalert).
- ✅ Screenshots/GIFs:
  - Kibana Discover view showing `weblogs-*`
  - Line chart: requests over time by `status`
  - Data table: top `clientip` by 404s
  - Firewall visualization: `dpt` distribution, actions over time
  - Elastalert logs tail with triggered alerts
- ✅ A short demo video (90s) walking through:
  1. `docker compose up -d`
  2. `python3 scripts/generate_*`
  3. Kibana index patterns + dashboards
  4. Alerts in `docker compose logs -f elastalert`
- ✅ Document 3 security learnings (e.g., why cardinality helps detect scans).
- ✅ “Future Work” section with 3–5 bullets (Slack alerts, Filebeat modules, GeoIP).

Pro tip: Pin this repo on your GitHub profile and link a post on LinkedIn summarizing your build.
